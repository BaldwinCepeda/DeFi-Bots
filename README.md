### Problem Statement

In an attention economy, the focus is on maximizing the use of scarce resources. In other words, it is all about making sure that people are using their time and energy in the most efficient way possible. This usually means creating incentives for people to use their time and energy in ways that are beneficial to the economy as a whole.

One of the key ideas behind an attention economy is that people are more likely to pay attention to things that they find interesting or valuable. This means that businesses and other organizations need to create content and experiences that are interesting and valuable enough to capture people's attention.

Another key idea is that people have a limited amount of attention to give. This means that businesses need to compete for people's attention and make sure that they are providing something worth paying attention to.


GPT3 can answer complex questions by understanding the natural language used to ask the question, and then retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base. It can also generate an answer by reasoning from first principles, or by using heuristics.
